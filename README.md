# Anusha Ladha’s Portfolio
## Introduction

Hi! I’m Anusha Ladha, a second-year Computer Science & Engineering student at UCLA. This repository contains the code for my interactive 3D portfolio website. The site is designed as a floating island with three simple sections: About, Projects, and Contact.

## About This Project

I built this portfolio to create a more personal and immersive way to share my work. Instead of a standard static layout, the island provides a calm, visual environment that reflects my design style and personality.
